#### Keys Pressed:
* `Ctrl-R`, `i`, `<enter>`

Since `ssh cs15lwi23asw@ieng6.ucsd.edu` is in my command history, I types `Ctrl-R` and typed part of the command. 

## Step 2: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

#### Keys Pressed:
* `<up><up><up><enter>`

I used the git clone command by going up in my command history by 3.

## Step 3: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

#### Keys Pressed:
* `cd `, `l`, `<tab>`, <enter>
* `<up><up><up><up><up><enter>`
* `<up><up><up><up><up><enter>`
  
I entered the directory with `cd` command, then I accessed the compile and run commands in my command history by going up by 5.

## Step 4: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

#### Keys Pressed:
* `nano`, `L`, `<tab>`, `.j`, `<tab>`, `<enter>`
* `<right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><right><delete><1>`
* `Ctrl-O`, `<enter>`, `Ctrl-X`
  
I entered the `nano` command and tabbed into the file `ListExample.java`. Then I moved with my finger pad to the line to fix and went right 12 times to delete `1`, and type `2`. Then I saved my results.
  
## Step 5: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed

#### Keys Pressed:
* `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`
* `<up><up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>`
  
Since the commands to compile and run, I went up by 7 to access the commands to demonstrate that the tests now run.
  
## Step 6: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

#### Keys Pressed:
* `git clone add L`, `<tab>, `.j`, `<tab>`, `<enter>`
* `git clone commit -m "Updated`
* `git push`
  
I entered the steps to commit and push the resulting changes to my account. I short-cutted the git clone add by tabbing the file, then I manually types the git clone commit.. and git push.
