# Lab Report 2 - Servers and Bugs (1/30/23)
## Part 1

**Task:** Write a web server `StringServer` that support the path and behavior described below. It should keep track of a single string that gets added to by incoming requests. The requests should look like this:

```
/add-message?s=<string>
```

Code:

```javascript
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;

class Handler implements URLHandler {

    String output = "";
    public String handleRequest(URI url) {
        System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
        if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {
            String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
            output+=parameters[1] + '\n';
        }
        return output;
    }
}

class StringServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if(args.length == 0){
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }

        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);

        Server.start(port, new Handler());
    }
}
```

#### Request: `/add-message?s=hi!`

* The methods that are called are .getPath, .contains, .getQuery, .split
* The relevant arguments to those methods are args[0] (the port number), "/add-message", "=".
* `output` is appended with new message for every  `/add-message`
* The first message displays `hi!` only because `ouput` only holds that string since it was previously empty.

#### Request: `/add-message?s=my name is esther :-)`

* The methods that are called are .getPath, .contains, .getQuery, .split
* The relevant arguments to those methods are args[0] (the port number), "/add-message", "=".
* `output` is appended with new message for every  `/add-message`
*  Since `/add-message` is called again, the command appends the message to `ouput`, which stores the past messages, then displays the whole string of messages.

## Part 2

A failure-inducing input:
```javascript
public void testReverseInPlace() {
int[] input1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3, 2, 1 }, input1);
}
```

An input that doesn't induce a failure:
```javascript
public void testReverseInPlace() {
int[] input1 = { 3 };
ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```

The symptom of the two tests:

Before(bug):
```javascript
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```

After:
```javascript
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int[] temp = arr.clone();
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        arr[i] = temp[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
}
```

The fix addressed the issue of needing to create a temp array cloned from the original. That way, all the elements in the original array can be assigned correctly, using the temp array. The code with the bug lost values when assigning elements to new indices. For example, when you loop through the code with i = 0, you replace the 0th index with the last index value. However, you lose the value of that 0th index and as a result, you cannot successfully reverse the array completely. If we have an array { 1, 2, 3 }, the method would change this array into { 3, 2, 3 } because in the last loop, it gets the value of the 0th index, which is 3 because we changed it. This motivated me to use a temp array to hold and save each value of the indices so that no values are lost in the process of replacing each index.



## Part 3

Something I learned from the labs are how to build and run a web server, as well as how to run the server using a remote computer. I also learned about paths and the various commands you can create and implement to the website. Some examples include /add-message, /count, and /increment.
